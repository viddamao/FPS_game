Math Check

Just as I described previously in the proposal, the game is a FPS game in a rendered map, therefore the first and most crucial problem is collision detection.

The math model for this problem is some what similar to the ray tracing problem.
So just imagine a similar FPS game like Counter Strike or Call of Duty,
the player class will keep track of the current position of the weapon and the direction of the weapon pointing at.
We call them pos[x,y,z]         position 
and dir[x,y,z]					normalized direction vector

so we can get a set of points on the array.
R(t)= pos + dir * t with t>0.0

Then to build the model of the enemy to enable ray tracing.
To make the model simpler, I am  thinking of instead of using complex models, multiple spherical hit zones will be defined on enemy that only hitting those zones will cause damage.

So we are able to do multiple ray traces on those spheres.
If a sphere zone is hit, corresponding hp will be subtracted from the enemy.
